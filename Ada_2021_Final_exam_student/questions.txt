Questions of Students

1. Write a procedure named "Print_Scores", that receives an argument of type **T_Scores** 
   definded in "students.ads" and prints all different scores.

   Example Output: the output of the Scores of first student:
    "Math: 18
     Ada: 16
     Optic: 15
     Physics: 15
     Chemical: 14
     Biology: 14
     FLE: 14"
    
2. Write a procedure named "Print_All_Students", that receives **no argument**,
   prints all information of each student by the order: Name, Description, Scores.

   Example Output: the first one should be:
    "Name: HaoKai Lin
     Description: Hard Working Guy!
     Scores:
        Math: 18
        Ada: 16
        Optic: 15
        Physics: 15
        Chemical: 14
        Biology: 14
        FLE: 14"
    
3. Write a function named "Average_Scores", that receives an argument of type **T_Scores**,
   return the average value of all scores for different subjects.

   Write a procedure named "Class_Score", that receives an argument of Float,
   print the class of average score of a student, following the standard:
    A+ : score >= 18;
    A : 18 < score <= 14;
    B+ : 14 < score <= 12;
    B : 12 < score <= 10;
    C : score < 10

    Write a test procedure using the last functions to print informations of all students

   Example Output: the first one should be:
    "Name: HaoKai Lin
     Description: Hard Working Guy!
     Average Scores: 15.14285
     Class: A"

4. Create an article type named "T_Scores_UF", which contains 4 Float values: 
    the average score of "Math & Ada" => "MA" 
    the average score of "Optic & Physics" => "OP",
    the average score of "Chemical & Biology" => "CB",
    the weighted total average score => "WTA"

    the weight for different UF is as follows:
        MA  : 5 credits
        OP  : 4 credits
        CB  : 4 credits
        FLE : 2 credits
    
    write a function named "Transform" that receive an argument of type T_Scores, 
    return the transformed **T_Scores_UF** object.

    Write a test procedure that prints all transformed **T_Scores_UF** objects for all students.

    Example Output: the first one should be:
       "Name: HaoKai Lin
        Scores UF:
            MA: 17.0
            OP: 15.0
            CB: 14.0
            WTA: 15.2666667"
